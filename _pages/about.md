The second law of thermodynamics states that 'Entropy', i.e. a measure of disorder, is always increasing. Life gets messy, bills get overdue, and wishes remain unfulfilled. The only way to make things orderly again is to add energy. We can all contribute to making our lives and everything around us better. Some very important tools in our arsenal include data, analysis, and practice.

In data, we want clean, relevant, and useful data. In analysis we want clear, logical, and predictive analysis. In practice, we want targeted, disciplined, and deliberate practice. We can all use these elements to battle Entropy and bring a little joy each day to those around us!
